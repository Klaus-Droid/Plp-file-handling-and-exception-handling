📂 File Read & Write Challenge & Error Handling Lab
🖋️ File Read & Write Challenge

This project demonstrates how to work with files in Python. The program reads the contents of an input file and writes a modified version of that content to a new file. This exercise strengthens your understanding of how data can be stored, retrieved, and transformed in real-world applications.

🧪 Error Handling Lab

In addition to file operations, the program incorporates exception handling. When the user is prompted to enter a filename:

If the file exists and can be read, the program proceeds normally.

If the file doesn’t exist, or can’t be opened due to permissions, the program displays a clear error message instead of crashing.

This teaches you to build robust and user-friendly programs.

🎉 Outcomes

By completing this module, you will be able to:

Open, read, and write files in Python.

Create new files and save processed results.

Handle common errors gracefully with try...except.

Write more resilient applications that can deal with unexpected issues.

▶️ Example Usage
Enter the filename to read: sample.txt
✅ File read successfully.
✅ New file 'sample_modified.txt' created with modified content.


If the file doesn’t exist:

Enter the filename to read: missing.txt
❌ Error: The file 'missing.txt' was not found.

📚 Skills Gained

Efficient file management in Python.

Practical use of open(), with, read(), and write().

Exception handling with try, except, and finally.

Writing code that is both functional and fault-tolerant.
